## RockClimbingLogBook
 
This program is a digital logbook that can be used to track climbing routes and sessions, serving as an alternative to a simple journal with a few bonus features that aim to make it a little more useful and a little more interesting than just paper and pencil.

The current focus moving forward with this project is to expand some of the features like statistics and session tracking, in addition to a constant effort to beautify the user interface.

# Key Features

1. An interface allowing the user to easily interact with an SQLite database
2. Homepage with a menu bar and central text section with a description and changelog
3. Options for adding/removing custom routes to/from the database
4. View page for routes
5. Ability to record an entire climbing session at one time
6. Tracking of climbing sessions
7. Statistics page with several meaningful and interesting statistics, ranging from total routes climbed to calculations of the user's flash and redpoint grades
8. Safe exit from the program, verifying that all runtimes will be shutdown before program termination

# Future Plans
- Fix climbing session view page
- More informative view pages for routes and sessions
- Location info
- Additional statistics, including graphs and charts of data
- Beautification
